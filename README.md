# Introduction to Theoretical Computer Science

My solutions of lab tasks from subject "Introduction to Theoretical Computer Science" (Uvod u Teoriju Računarstva - UTR), academic year 2014./2015 - fourth semester on
_Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing (FER)_.

## Content

* [Simulation of  Nondeterministic Finite Automaton With ε-moves](https://github.com/hermanzdosilovic/utr/tree/master/lab-1)
* [Minimization of Deterministic Finite Automaton](https://github.com/hermanzdosilovic/utr/tree/master/lab-2)

## How I Tested My Solutions

We were given some dummy test data to check our solutions on our machine.
I used [ev](https://github.com/hermanzdosilovic/ev) for testing my code.
