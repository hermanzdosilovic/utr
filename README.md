# Introduction to Theoretical Computer Science

My solutions of lab tasks from subject "Introduction to Theoretical Computer Science" (Uvod u Teoriju Računarstva - UTR), academic year 2014./2015 - fourth semester on
_Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing (FER)_.

## Content

* [Simulation of  Nondeterministic Finite Automaton with ε-moves](https://github.com/hermanzdosilovic/utr/tree/master/lab-1)
* [Deterministic Finite Automaton Minimization](https://github.com/hermanzdosilovic/utr/tree/master/lab-2)

## Bad practice alert

All classes are in the same (default) package because assignment told so (probably because of tests they would run afterwards to test the solution).
